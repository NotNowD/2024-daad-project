RNA-sequencing in irradiated and normal A549 cells.

The aim of this study is to investigate the role of circRNAs/miRNAs/lncRNAs in radioresistance in A549 cells. For irradiation, A549 cells were exposed to a single fraction 2 GY or 4GY X-ray dose using an X-RAD 160-225 instrument (Precision X-Ray, Inc., Branford, CT, USA; filter: 2 mm AI; 42 cm, 225 kV/s, 12.4 mA, 2.0 Gy/min). The irradiated A549 cells (after a single dose of irradiation) and normal A549 cells were cultured for further 48h and then collected its total RNA for high-throughput sequencing. Overall design: Examing 3 conditions, each with 3 replicates. The three groups were 0GY group (control), 2GY group (treatment-1) and 4GY group (treatment-2).
